<h2 id="executive-summary-vision">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / VISION</h2>

<pre><code>The executive summary is a 2-3 paragraph text meant to sell, not describe. It should include:
    - the grab:     open with your big idea
    - the problem:  what problem do you solve
    - the solution: what solution do you offer

LikeRiser Inc. develops social media web apps. This marketing plan illustrates our market segments and the strategies we are employing to aquire customers and secure a solid revenue stream. We are unique because BLAH, the problem we solve is BLAH, our approach is BLAH, e.g. we are awesome and expect 90% our revenue stream to come from small businesses subscriptions within the next 3 years.

  <p>US social media ad spending will reach $9.2 billion in 2016, forecasts BIA/Kelsey in its US Local Social Media Forecast for 2012-2016, released November 2012. That figure is up from an estimated $4.6 billion in spending this year, and represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.2%.</p>
  
  <p>This latest forecast again sees the local segment of social media ad revenues growing faster than the national segment. Specifically, local social spending will grow from $1.1 billion in 2012 to $2.95 billion in 2016 for a CAGR of 28%. National spending will grow from $3.47 billion to $6.26 billion. So, while roughly three-quarters of social media spend this year is estimated to be national, that share is predicted to drop to about 68% by 2016
